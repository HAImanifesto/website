> *The AI:M Manifesto is a public call — and it needs public voices.* 

If you believe in transparency, integrity, and clarity in the age of human–AI collaboration, **take action now**. Whether you're a creator, publisher, academic, technologist, or policymaker, **your support matters** — and it starts with one of the simple steps below.

## 1. Take Action

Pick one or more of the following:
- **Publish the Manifesto.** Repost it on your own website, blog, newsletter, intranet, or repository. Include a visible link back to HAImanifesto.org.
- **Mention it in your work.** Add a note of support or a link in your publication, project credits, classroom materials, policy brief, or tool documentation.
- **Use the AI:M Score.** Apply it to a recent piece of work — a poem, article, dataset, AI-generated artwork — and disclose the balance between human and machine.
- **Share it.** Post the Manifesto or a quote from it on social media, with your own comment. Use hashtag #HAImanifesto. 
- **Sign the Manifesto.** Add your name to the growing list of individuals and organizations who support transparent AI authorship.

## 2. Tell Us What You Did

We want to showcase real-world support and action. 
After you've taken one or more steps,\
**Email us** at *HAImanifesto.org@gmail.com* with:\
- **A short description** of your action
- **A public link** (to your site, article, repository, social post, etc.)

We'll list selected contributors on the site and help amplify your voice in the growing AI:M community.

## 3. Why It Matters

The call for transparency won't become known and encouraged by as many people on its own. Every mention, every repost, every badge added to a footer or GitHub readme — helps normalize responsible AI collaboration. You don't need permission. You don't need to wait. **You just need to act.**

**Get involved today — and help keep authorship human.**
