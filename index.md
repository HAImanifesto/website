*A New Creative Paradigm for Human / Artificial Intelligence*

A new era of authorship has arrived. Most creators — novelists, designers, coders, composers — already weave generative AI into their process, sketching storyboards, remixing beats, or colour-grading photos at machine speed. Yet no algorithm can feel doubt, pride or moral duty; that power remains human.
**Keeping that living core visible — mapping where human and machine meet — is of utmost importance, so creators, publishers, and audiences stay oriented.**

## HAI/ Framework

> The HAI/ Framework provides a method for identifying, classifying, and communicating the involvement of artificial intelligence in the creation of a work.

Its goal is to make the degree of human–machine collaboration visible and understandable — both for those who create content and for those who evaluate, publish, or experience it. 

It encourages **creators** to clearly state how AI tools were used, and invites **publishers**, **institutions**, and **audiences** to appreciate this transparency not only as context, but as something that enriches the authenticity, clarity, and meaning of the work itself.

The framework does not prescribe how AI should be used.
It offers a structure for describing that use — openly, responsibly, and in context. 

## HAI/ Principles

This framework is based on the acknowledgment that machines may contribute, but the human remains the source of intention, judgment, and responsibility — a foundation that gives rise to the following key principles:

1. **AI contributions must be transparent.** We have a right to know how something was made.  
2. **Collaboration is layered.** HAI/ makes space for shared processes, without confusion about origin.
3. **Responsibility stays with people.** Decisions, interpretations, and impacts are human matters.


## HAI/ Score

The HAI/ Score is a classification system that signals the degree and nature of AI involvement in the creation of any work — novel, film sequence, orchestral score, source code — ranking it from fully human-made to fully machine-generated with distinct levels reflecting the balance of authorship.

The meaning of the score is always contextual. Some situations — such as personal expression or educational evaluation — may call for minimal AI involvement. Others — such as technical, scientific, or analytical work — may benefit from more substantial support, especially when accuracy, consistency, or scale are priorities.


## HAI/ Scale  

---

### **HAI/0** - *Fully human-authored.*

![HAI Score 0](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S0.svg){: width="100" height="100" }
 
**Human Intelligence:** Full authorship: idea, structure, writing, editing.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** None. No digital assistance beyond basic tools like typing.  

---

### **HAI/1** – *AI as proofreader.*

![HAI Score 1](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S1.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:**  Provides full content and structure.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Spelling, punctuation, minor grammar fixes. AI used only for surface-level corrections, with no effect on meaning or style. 

---

### **HAI/2** – *AI as verifier.*

![HAI Score 2](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S2.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human writes everything; Generates ideas, writes and edits content.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** AI assists only with basic clarity and logic checks. Supports human thinking without reshaping the work. Suggests clarifications, flags inconsistencies. 

---

### **HAI/3** – *AI as stylist.*

![HAI Score 3](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S3.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human authorship with AI assistance on form, tone, or voice. Writes content and defines the core message.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Refines the form without altering substance. Rewrites passages for clarity, tone, or flow. 

---

### **HAI/4** – *AI as architect.*

![HAI Score 4](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S4.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human defines what to say; Provides the core idea, thesis, or message.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** AI proposes how to say it structurally based on human intent. Builds outline, section structure, and flow. 

---

### **HAI/5** – *AI as co-author.*

![HAI Score 5](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S5.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human defines the vision; Provides topic, intent, and guidance.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** AI produces much of the initial content. Produces under human direction. Generates outline and writes first drafts. 

---

### **HAI/6** – *AI as autonomous drafter.*

![HAI Score 6](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S6.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human provides only creative spark. Offers a prompt, theme, or starting idea.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** AI creates full content from a minimal human prompt or concept. Develops full structure and detailed content. 

---

### **HAI/7** – *AI as lead author.*

![HAI Score 7](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S7.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human curates or selects among AI-generated versions. Human plays a reviewing role; Sets goal, gives light feedback, selects output.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** AI explores and evolves the draft. Produces multiple versions and refines content. 

---

### **HAI/8** – *AI as sole creator.*

![HAI Score 8](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S8.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** Human involvement is passive or distant. Provides only a general topic or intent to publish.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** AI authors the work from start to finish; Invents idea, structure, content, and revisions. 

---

### **HAI/9** – *Fully AI-authored.*

![HAI Score 9](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S9.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

**Human Intelligence:** None. Human did not contribute to ideation, structure, or selection but merely triggers or uploads the result.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Fully AI-generated with no human creative input. Complete authorship: concept, writing, style, and editing.
