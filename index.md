> *A New Creative Paradigm for Human / Artificial Intelligence*

Authorship is evolving. Most creators — novelists, designers, coders, composers — already weave generative AI into their process, sketching storyboards, remixing beats, or colour-grading photos at machine speed. Yet no algorithm can feel doubt, pride or moral duty; that power remains human.
**Keeping that living core visible — mapping where human and machine meet — is of utmost importance, so creators, publishers, and audiences stay oriented.**

## HAI/ Framework

> The HAI/ Framework provides a method for identifying, classifying, and communicating the involvement of artificial intelligence in the creation of a work.

Its goal is to make the degree of human–machine collaboration visible and understandable — both for those who create content and for those who evaluate, publish, or experience it. 

It encourages **creators** to clearly state how AI tools were used, and invites **publishers**, **institutions**, and **audiences** to appreciate this transparency not only as context, but as something that enriches the authenticity, clarity, and meaning of the work itself.

The framework does not prescribe how AI should be used.
It offers a structure for describing that use — openly, responsibly, and in context. 

## HAI/ Principles

This framework is based on the acknowledgment that machines may contribute, but the human remains the source of intention, judgment, and responsibility — a foundation that gives rise to the following key principles:

1. **AI contributions must be transparent.** We have a right to know how something was made.  
2. **Collaboration is layered.** HAI/ makes space for shared processes, without confusion about origin.
3. **Responsibility stays with people.** Decisions, interpretations, and impacts are human matters.


## HAI/ Score

The HAI/ Score is a **classification system**, supported by scorecards, that signals the degree and nature of AI involvement in the creation of any work — novel, film sequence, orchestral score, source code — ranking it from fully human-made to fully machine-generated with distinct levels reflecting the balance of authorship.

> The meaning of the score is always contextual. 

Some situations — such as personal expression or educational evaluation — may call for minimal AI involvement. Others — such as technical, scientific, or analytical work — may benefit from more substantial support, especially when accuracy, consistency, or scale are priorities.
