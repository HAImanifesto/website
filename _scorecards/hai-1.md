## Structure: 
**Human Intelligence:** The entire content is conceived, written, and shaped by the human author. Structure, arguments, style, and tone are fully determined by human intention.
**Artificial Intelligence:** Minimal surface-level intervention. AI is used solely for correcting grammar, punctuation, or spelling — without influencing the meaning, structure, or voice of the text.

## Description:
HAI/1 represents a work in which the human creator retains full authorship while using AI tools strictly for technical clean-up. The core ideas, expressions, and narrative choices remain untouched. AI’s role is limited to functioning like a mechanical proofreader — flagging or correcting surface-level errors without contributing suggestions that affect the content or its delivery.

This category does not include stylistic rewriting, clarity enhancements, or automated rephrasing. It also excludes the use of AI for content generation, outline proposals, or paraphrasing prompts. Any such involvement would exceed HAI/1.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- Academic or professional writing that permits proofreading but not stylistic or conceptual assistance.
- Projects that prioritize a human-authored voice with polished technical accuracy.
- Publishing environments where light editing support is acceptable, but human authorship must remain dominant and clear.
- Transparency declarations for works refined only at the level of spelling and grammar via AI tools.
