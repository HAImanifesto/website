![AI Score 4](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/AIM_sticker_darkPlate10_S4.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

## Structure:
**Human Intelligence:** The human defines the purpose, main message, and intent of the work. The core themes, direction, and decisions remain human-led, but some structural elements are shaped in dialogue with AI suggestions.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Actively contributes to organizing or reconfiguring the structure and formulation. AI may suggest storyboards, sequence ordering, scene breakdowns, layout grids, track arrangements. — while the human accepts, modifies, or rejects these inputs.

## Description:
AI:4 represents a more integrated form of collaboration. The human author still owns the core message and governs the process, but AI plays a noticeable role in shaping how that message is built. This can include proposing outlines, reorganizing content flow, or suggesting where and how points could be introduced or grouped.

AI may also participate in reformulating ideas during this structural development — not by generating original content, but by providing alternatives in how existing human ideas are composed and delivered. At this level, the boundary between AI as a stylist and AI as a structural co-planner becomes relevant.

This score is appropriate when AI’s involvement is clearly visible in how the work is organized or composed, yet not in generating new content or determining the author’s original intention.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- Editorial planning processes where AI helps structure long-form content, such as essays, articles, or reports.
- Creative projects where a human vision is realized with AI support in organizing the narrative or argument.
- Academic or professional writing using AI to optimize flow and readability, while keeping human judgment central.
- Contexts where AI serves as a structural partner, shaping the framework without controlling the content.
