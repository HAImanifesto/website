## Structure:
**Human Intelligence:** The content, structure, and message are developed and authored by the human. The core meaning, arguments, and creative direction remain entirely human-driven.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Used to refine expression. AI refines expression (e.g., re-lights an image, smooths a voice-over, rephrases dialogue) to improve clarity, tone, or flow — without altering the intended meaning or introducing new ideas.

## Description:
AI:3 reflects a collaboration in which the human author defines what is being said, while the AI assists in how it is said. The author retains control over substance and direction but delegates stylistic polishing — such as making a sentence smoother, adjusting tone for a target audience, or tightening wordiness.

The role of AI at this level is comparable to that of a language editor focused on form, not content. It can rewrite passages or propose clearer formulations, but never changes the message, adds conceptual material, or restructures the work.

If AI begins to shape structure, influence argument flow, or suggest new content, the work surpasses AI:3.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- Editorial workflows where AI is used to enhance readability and stylistic consistency.
- Writing tasks that require adapting tone for publication, while preserving original human ideas.
- Projects where human authorship is primary, but fluency or expressiveness benefits from AI refinement.
- Contexts in which AI assists as a non-intrusive language enhancer, not a content collaborator.
