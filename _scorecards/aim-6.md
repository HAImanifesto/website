![AI Score 6](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/AIM_sticker_darkPlate10_S6.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

## Structure:
**Human Intelligence:** The human initiates or oversees the process, possibly defining the topic, tone, or purpose. Human involvement may include prompt writing, selective editing, or curating from multiple AI outputs — but not full authorship.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** produces the majority of the work (e.g., imagery, code, audio, or text) from prompts or parameter sets, often in full sections or drafts, which are either lightly edited or selectively compiled by the human.

## Description:
AI:6 marks a significant shift in authorship toward the machine. While a human remains involved — typically as a prompt designer, editor, or curator — the voice, language, and development of ideas are primarily produced by AI. The human may direct the outcome, but no longer personally writes the majority of the final material.

At this level, AI outputs are not just tools for inspiration or improvement; they are the material. The human may intervene to improve coherence, cut redundancies, or combine outputs, but the bulk of the content originates from generative AI.

This score applies when the resulting work would not exist in its current form without AI-generated language — even if a human shaped or arranged it.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- Drafting long-form content by prompting AI paragraph by paragraph or section by section.
- Using AI to generate multiple versions and choosing the best with minimal rewriting.
- Human–AI collaborations where the machine provides most of the written substance.
- Environments where speed, volume, or experimentation outweighs human stylistic control.
