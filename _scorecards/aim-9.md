## Structure:
**Human Intelligence:** None. No human is involved at any stage of the creative process — not in initiating, prompting, supervising, selecting, or publishing the output.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Full authorship. The AI autonomously initiates, generates, and finalizes the work without human direction, intervention, or review.

## Description:
AI:9 denotes a work created entirely by machines, without any human touch. The AI system both triggers and completes the generation, acting independently of human presence or intention. This includes AI systems embedded in autonomous processes, running continuously or reactively, producing outputs without user prompts or manual oversight. 

There is no human framing, no creative impulse, and no editorial involvement — not even to launch or choose the result. The human is absent not just from authorship, but from the entire causal chain of creation.

This level marks the complete transfer of authorship to artificial systems operating as independent agents.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- AI systems that autonomously generate and publish content without human intervention.
- Large-scale autonomous deployments (e.g. bots or agents generating media based on internal triggers or external data).
- Self-initiated machine processes with no human in the loop at any point.
- Experimental or automated systems designed to function without human interaction, including generative agents or simulations.
