![AI Score 5](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/AIM_sticker_darkPlate10_S5.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

## Structure:
**Human Intelligence:** The human author remains the principal guide — defining goals, evaluating outputs, and making final decisions. The core ideas often originate from the human, but some content may be adapted or co-developed through prompts and iterations.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Actively contributes to the writing itself. AI generates substantive portions—text passages, design comps, music loops, code modules—based on human prompts based on human prompts, and its outputs are retained — possibly with human editing — as part of the final work.

## Description:
AI:5 signals a balanced partnership in which AI participates in content creation. The human provides intent, framing, and judgment, while AI contributes substantive language. The process often involves iterative prompting, with the human shaping and refining the AI’s outputs to suit their needs — but not entirely rewriting or replacing them.

At this level, the line between drafting and editing becomes collaborative. The human may write some parts entirely, while others are generated by AI and included directly or lightly modified. The final voice may blend human and AI elements, with visible machine fingerprints in phrasing, transitions, or expressions.

This score applies when AI-generated language is present in the final product in a meaningful way, even if prompted and shaped by human decisions.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- Creative or commercial writing workflows using AI to accelerate drafting.
- Communication tasks where efficiency is key and AI helps formulate the base text.
- Projects where humans define direction and voice but let AI draft substantial portions.
- Educational or exploratory settings where AI is used to test formulations and co-create ideas.
