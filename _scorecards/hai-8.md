![HAI Score 8](/assets/scorecards/translucent-dark/HAI_sticker_darkPlate10_S8.svg){: width="100" height="100" }

## Structure:
**Human Intelligence:** None in the content creation process. The human provides no creative input, prompt, or supervision during the generation. If present, the human’s role is limited to initiating the system or triggering automated output without influencing what is produced.\
**Artificial Intelligence:** Independently generates the work. The AI produces all content — including structure, ideas, and language — with no real-time human involvement or prompt refinement.

## Description:
HAI/8 represents a fully automated creation process. The content is entirely generated by AI without any human direction during the act of creation. This may involve running pre-set scripts, using autonomous agents, or retrieving outputs from AI systems based on default or inherited parameters.

The human does not intervene in prompt design, does not steer the generation in real-time, and does not select between multiple versions. The AI functions as an autonomous creative agent, responsible for the entire form and substance of the output.

This score goes beyond AI-led authorship into full machine-generated authorship, without any immediate human intention shaping the content.

## Contexts Where This Applies:
- Generative processes triggered by automation (e.g. scheduled AI-generated news updates).
- Art, writing, or media generated without prompt input or human curation.
- Systems that produce outputs based on templates or predefined rules without situational human involvement.
- Use cases where the AI’s autonomy, not human creativity, defines the output.
